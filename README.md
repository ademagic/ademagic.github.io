# The miko.ademagic.com Github Repo

This is the codebase for miko.ademagic.com, my home on the internet. Powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using a customised version of [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/), a theme for [Poole](http://getpoole.com/). Most the magic you'll see here was spun up by Mark Otto [(@mdo)](http://www.twitter.com/mdo).

title: Hello, world! Again!
---

I've done it again! Third CMS, and twice the attempts at a personal blog. This time, my blog's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/), and styled by [Hyde](http://andhyde.com).

### Why Hyde? ###

Well, a few reasons actually:
    
    1. It was recommended to me by Fiona Chan, and she usually knows what she's talking about :)
    2. I grow tired of endless text-editors, and wanted something I felt I could customise.
    3. Got sick of paying for hosting I wasn't using or maintaining.
    4. According to mdo, "Hyde is also rather forward-thinking in that—in addition to Chrome, Safari, and Firefox—it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above."
    5. Felt like learning something new.

My thoughts thus far are that it's pretty good - though I haven't got much experience with it yet, nothing's been wrong with it so far. The true test will be how quickly I'll be able to throw a rant together when it does piss me off for some reason.

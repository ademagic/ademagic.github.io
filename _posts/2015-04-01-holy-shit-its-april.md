title: Holy shit it's april
synopsis: A recap of what I've done since promising all the things I'd do this year, and how I failed.
---
Yes, we are a quarter of the way through 2015. No april fools joke. Time flies.

I wrote a blog post back in January saying how I was going to make updates to my website's repo weekly. After a quick check of the very cool contributions counter on my github page, I noticed I'd failed already. Barely any updates to my website since January. Hell, not even to my local fork! What have I been doing with my time?

##Excuses

I like to tell myself that in the meantime, I've still been productive. Instead of contributing to my website, this is what I've actually been doing [progress in square brackets]:
<ul>
    <li>Improving my skills as a UX designer through tutorials, and by <em>trying</em> to find courses and certificates worth my time. [10%]</li>
    <li>Working on a design and development portfolio, complete with case studies of live work. [5%]</li>
    <li>Designing the new look and layout for this website. [5%]</li>
    <li>Redesigning the <a target="_blank" href="www.schnitmydadsays.com">Schnitmydadsays</a> website. [50%]</li>
    <li>Learning Angular. [20%]</li>
    <li>Trying to work out how to make Jekyll use gulp</li>
    <li>Coming up with a list of about 20 blog post ideas, 3 of which are already sitting in my drafts.</li>
    <li>Working on my own slide decks.</li>
    <li>Working on the presentation for my next talk.</li>
</ul>

##Other stuff that's stolen my time

I'd be lying if I said I was constantly working on stuff that was taking me away from working on my new year's resolution. Other stuff that has cost me my time includes:

<ul>
    <li>I've logged 63.8 hours on <a target="_blank" href="http://playstarbound.com/">Starbound</a>.</li>
    <li>I'm writing and drawing my own comic (which I'm sure I'll blog about more in the coming months).</li>
    <li>I'm learning to play <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJYm0qVIhFI">Roland Dyens's arrangement of "Tango el Choclo"</a></li>
</ul>

So if you've been holding me accountable for some reason, there you go. Though I have, and it's hardly making me feel better.

title: The Murty Mantra - How I organise myself
synopsis: The combination of apps and processes I use to organise my ideas and my projects. And somewhat the rest of my life.
---

I've always had problems focusing on one thing for very long periods of time. My memory's never been too great either. Thankfully, I'm not the only one – on average, we are becoming less patient and are worse at remembering things<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. I say thankfully because on the brightside, there are countless apps and solutions to help us overcome those woes.

Inspired mostly by my friend and former coworker <a href="http://www.brendanmurty.com" target="_blank">Brendan Murty</a>, I've come up with a foolproof<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> way to make sure that I get my ideas down, work out my tasks and to-dos, and be sure I get them done.

##The Murty Mantra
He probably doesn't realise he's actively doing this, but when I follow my process I keep in mind what Guru Murty taught me about notetaking and tasklists:
<ol>
<li><strong>Don't be vague.</strong> Be clear. Everything you're writing now you're explaining to a clueless, future you.</li>
<li><strong>Omit nothing.</strong> Take down any immediate ideas and thoughts you have. Be sure to follow rule 1.</li>
<li><strong>Act fast.</strong> You're doing this because you're forgetful. The sooner you write it down, the sooner you won't forget it<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. This is essential to rules 1 and 2.</li>
<li><strong>Live and die by deadlines.</strong> If something is (even in the slightest way) time sensitive, give it a deadline. If you miss them, extend them. Feel bad about missing them. Don't dismiss them.</li>
</ol>

##The Arsenal
Thanks to technology, rules 3 and 4 are pretty easy to follow. Not being a fan of complex and demanding applications, I've whittled it down to 4 lines of defense:

<h3><a href="http://www.glamtropez.com/totalrecall/" target="_blank">1. Total Recall</a></h3>
In high school, my science teacher Ms Bebris was all about mind maps (and not so much about science). We made mind maps for everything. As a result, I find mind maps really handy for getting ideas down quickly, and drilling down on specific branches of ideas.

<a href="http://www.glamtropez.com/totalrecall/" target="_blank">Total Recall</a> is a simple, elegant Mind Map app that allows me to brainstorm and save organised mind maps on my ipad. You can pick it up on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/total-recall-mind-map/id360443748?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes</a>, though I'm not sure about support for other platforms. There are plenty of alternative apps, but I went with this one basically because it's free. There are other apps that offer access to maps across multiple devices, which might be useful for me in the future. 

I only use mind maps for projects I feel are more difficult to execute where I'd need to get my thoughts down on paper (so to speak). Once I've explored an idea enough and I have a mind map together, I'm ready to start creating tasks for myself.

<h3><a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/" target="_blank">2. Wunderlist</a></h3>
List taking should never be taken for granted. This app is probably my most frequently used and most useful – I have it running on my Mac, my iPhone and my iPad, and they all sync constantly.

<a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/" target="_blank">Wunderlist</a> makes it easy for me to create a simple list of tasks or ideas, and shares it across all my devices. To me, each item becomes a task, each task can get subtasks and have notes taken against it. Depending on the list, I might even order the tasks in order of importance. I use it to organise other aspects of my life too: Shopping, Website, Blogposts, Songs to learn, Movies to watch, Projects etc.

The free version of this app provides me with all the functionality I need. There's also a <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/pro/" target="_blank">pro version</a> which gives you more collaborative functionality that you might find useful if you're working with someone else on a project.

<h3><a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">3. Trello</a></h3>
Once I decide that things have gotten too complex for Wunderlist (which they seldom do), I start ripping the list items and subtasks into tasks to track on trello.

<a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> is a task keeping app/kanban board. Usually, if I have a task with many subtasks, or the tasks get more statuses than simply "done" or not, it's a good indicator that it deserves a trello board e.g. tasks for my client projects may have a phase where they're being reviewed by the client.

<h3><a href="https://calendar.google.com" target="_blank">4. Google Calendar</a></h3>
I mainly use Google Calendar for tasks that I know will take a good portion of my day, or are very time-sensitive; Like appointments or meetings, for example. I never use it for complex tasks, or to store information other than possibly links to tasks in existing apps. Blocking out slots of time to complete the tasks you've assigned yourself in your other apps is also never a bad idea.

###The Good Ol' Paper and Pen
Ok I lied, I have 5 techniques. This one shouldn't be counted though. 
If you're a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_learning" target="_blank">visual learner</a> (like most of you claim, but I believe all of us are) then a pen and paper by your side when you're working is invaluable. If you get into the habit of writing ideas out, it can be an excellent physical representation of your thoughts and usually helps me fuel the apps I mentioned above. Also, it's great for doodling and sketching, but that's for another blog post...

I'm still perfecting my method, but so far it's working well for me. I've been able to quickly act upon shower epiphanies, and I have enough ideas noted down to fuel blog posts for the remainder of the year. If you've got suggestions or your own method that you think could help me, please teach me!

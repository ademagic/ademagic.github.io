title: New Year, New Website
---

Before I go on, happy 2015! Hope the new year brings you all the good stuff, and that you figure out what to do with it.

I hope you set yourself some new year's resolutions as well. I take mine pretty seriously, and will usually set myself one major goal per year which I must achieve at all costs (so I set very achievable goals). This year I'm being less lazy and setting many; One of them being to make <a href="http://github.com/ademagic/ademagic.github.io" target="_blank">weekly updates to my website</a>.

Yes, that repo's been alive for over a year. Yes, I've been pretty inactive on it. So in the hopes of getting to a state I'm proud of with this site, I'll be making small and frequent changes. Well, weekly â€“ relatively frequent I guess.

## What to expect
I'll be refreshing the design of the website, and developing a splash page where I plan to have a bit of fun and showcase my skills. I haven't decided how I'll go about doing that yet, but it's gonna be awesome. For now, I'll just continue modifying <a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/">lanyon</a> for a while longer.

Also, I'll be running a blog. Since I learn better by teaching, I'll mostly be writing about new front-end technologies and techniques I'm learning in the hopes that I learn something myself. I've also got a lot of hobbies, so every now and then there may be something related to that. Perhaps even the odd opinion piece.

## Current State
Incase the repo didn't give it away, ademagic.com is a blog run on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator that works on top of github pages. I decided to take that option because at this stage the site is doing nothing more than being a simple blog anyway. There was no need to have any server, db or cpanel access for my purposes. Plus, paying for github is cheaper than hosting, so that works out too.

While I write this post, the design relies heavily on <a href="http://getpoole.com/">poole</a> and <a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/">lanyon</a>. The modifications are so minimal, in fact, that I didn't even bother changing the lanyon or poole css files directly. I've got a css file of overrides that changes a few style rules, mainly overriding the original fonts.

##Help me!
If you have any recommendations or suggestions for things I could do or ways I could improve, leave me a comment or file an issue in the github repo. I'd love your feedback!

All the best in the new year.

Having a C/C++/Java/Allthethings programmer for a dad meant growing up was full of logic puzzles, maths, and little coding projects. I was being groomed into becoming a fully-fledged software developer all my life. 

As a kid, I'm not sure if it was my interest in art and design, seeing the poor aesthetic and usability choices my dad made in our little apps and programs that we wrote, or watching the Minority Report, that made me decide "Hey, someone should really specialise in this. Not quite a designer, more than just a programmer, maybe even a dash of psychologist? Maybe a 'User Interface Developer' who works on User Interfaces all day? That'd be an awesome job!".

Happy to say that I'm a UI developer based in Sydney, Australia.

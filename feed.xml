    <title>Release 2: Mostly Typography Updates</title>

      <p>If you know me, you know I blame all my hangups in Design on how long it takes me to decide on typography. Here's me having a second (and probably not last) go at improving it.</p>
<h3>Inline Code Blocks Facelift</h3>
<p>You know, the <code>&lt;code/&gt;</code> ones. They already steal enough cognitive attention without also being huge and bold. Now they're the same size as the text, with a little extra breathing room. Also changed some of the colours around to make them a little more subtle.</p>
<h3>Actual Font Weights</h3>
<p>I thought I kept importing bad Google Fonts, when actually I was using the Fonts v1 API syntax with a v2 API request. D'oh, Miko.</p>
<p>For now, I've imported two other weights for the Frank Ruhl Libre font family so that <strong>the strong tags</strong> have some more visual weight. More typography changes to come, I'm sure.</p>
<h3>Credits Page</h3>
<p>I really like <a href="https://dbanks.design" rel="external">Danny Banks</a>'s site, and I thought the idea of the open-source credits page was cool. So I've replaced the Hylia link in the footer with a link to my <a href="/credits">Credits</a> page. Hopefully more things make it on here as I go more crazy than just updating typography.</p>
<p>Next one's the homepage, I swear.</p>

    <title>Zoom Etiquette</title>

    <updated>2020-04-02T11:00:00+11:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p><img src="/images/zoom-etiquette/digital_transformation_covid.jpg" alt="Who led the digital transformation of your company? The C.E.O, C.T.O or Covid-19?" title="Be honest. Image from somewhere on twitter, if you know the original source please let me know."></p>
<p>By now you've probably had to use a video conferencing platform like <a href="https://zoom.us" target="_blank">Zoom</a> or <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/" target="_blank">Hangouts</a> to conduct a meeting. A &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; of faces talking at each other, hoping to not talk over their boss, occasionally catching their own reflections/portraits for a bit too long.</p>
<p><img src="/images/zoom-etiquette/The_Brady_Bunch.jpg" alt="The Brady Bunch 3x3 grid of faces, also a typical Zoom meeting" title="Your meeting, probably. Image from the Brady Bunch Wikipedia page."></p>
<p>You may have found this kind of meeting frustrating at times, but try to imagine a group of you were actually in a room together while the rest are in the video chat. The conversations stop including certain people, video chat participants become easy to ignore <em>and</em> can easily ignore you. This can be the reality of working in a distributed team.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to – there are simple things you can do to stay collaborative and inclusive. The main thing to keep in mind is that your distributed video chats need to try and emulate everybody being in the same room as best as possible, and the whole team needs to be aligned to this.</p>
<p>Here's how Design Operations (DOPS) at Finder did it.</p>
<h2>Before the Meeting</h2>
<p>It's helpful to identify some roles and rules as a team. This may not always be possible given you could be meeting with clients, but an awareness of these was very useful for us. We established these roles naturally, but intentionally defining these would help too.</p>
<h3>The Meeting Conductor</h3>
<p>The Conductor makes sure that people are heard, included, and have the chance to participate in discussions. This can be one or more people. This doesn't have to be your leader or manager, but is typically the person who also organised the meeting.</p>
<p>This role exists in in-person meetings as well - they're typically the person who makes sure the meeting stays on track. The difference now is that this person has to be aware of everyone in the video call, and politely make time for them to say something, especially if they've been attempting to.</p>
<p>Just like in in-person meetings, this person should be in charge of either note taking, organising note taking, or any other follow-up work that should come <a href="#heading-after-the-meeting">after the meeting</a>.</p>
<h3>The Loud Voices, The Quiet Voices</h3>
<p>People who are typically loud or talkative in meetings need to be aware of their habits, as they may unintentionally exclude the voices of other members in the team. Similarly, people who are reserved or quiet will often not get <em>or take</em> their chance to talk like their counterparts will. Calling this out (even in private) takes a lot of trust between team members, but we've found the benefits carry to other teams, too.</p>
<p>It's important to note that this is not an exercise to change people's personalities (i.e. get talkative people to shut up, get the reserved people to speak up) – it's an exercise of self awareness to help people judge how they can best contribute to the team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Okay, I think I'm talking too much – sorry Taylor, did you have something to say?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Kayne East realises he has been The Loud Voice</em></p>
<p>Making ourselves aware of which role we typically play means the Meeting Conductor can do a better job as well.</p>
<h2>During the Meeting</h2>
<p>Given that our meetings were both in person and using tech, there were a series of things we had to keep in mind throughout the meeting to keep it running smoothly.</p>
<h3>Sound Check</h3>
<p>When the meeting starts, you effectively just &quot;ninja&quot; in. The rest of the room may not be aware that you're in the meeting, and that's ok for meetings with more participants, or &quot;listening&quot; meetings. One habit we got into at the beginning of our meetings was to ensure that everyone can actually be heard, either by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making sure to start with conversation.</li>
<li>Greeting any person who joined, and waiting for an audible response.</li>
<li>If you haven't got an audible response, asking for a quick sound check. This is a little more explicit than just repeating step 2.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Video Feed</h3>
<p>It's very helpful if everyone can join with their video feed. Speaking face to face encourages empathy, and lets the meeting participants read your body language and emotional responses to conversations. However, sometimes participants can't have their video enabled for various reasons. This is ok, too.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that not all video is visible at once. Sometimes it's also necessary to disable video for the benefit of the connection.  Given that video can be unreliable, always remember to communicate first by talking. Only nodding and shaking your head, or gesturing, can be an especially hard habit to get out of.</p>
<h2>After the Meeting</h2>
<p>As in real life, it's still impossible to have a perfectly seamless conversation. It's important that after the meeting, the Meeting Conductor can follow up with the team and make sure that they all get their say in. It's helpful to have meeting notes that you can asynchronously add to, but is also just generally good practice when sharing information with a distributed team. This enables you to record and validate decisions more easily, and avoids creating tribal knowledge through documentation.</p>
<p>In summary, these are just techniques to help you on your way to making the most out of our new Work From Home reality. A meeting is only as effective as the participants are aligned and constructive. Hopefully a joint awareness and some common rules and guidelines to follow helps you achieve that alignment.</p>
<p>I'd like to reiterate a caveat though – these are techniques that worked for DOPS, a team with some distributed members which was also WFH-enabled. Today, we're living in different times. I'll leave you with this tweet for a bit of grounding.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;You are not working from home; you are at your home during a crisis trying to work.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve heard this twice today. I think it&#39;s an important distinction worth emphasising.</p>&mdash; Neil Webb (@neilmwebb) <a href="https://twitter.com/neilmwebb/status/1245012958415073282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
<p>What techniques have you found effective for running your video meetings? Leave me a comment below, I'm interested to hear them!</p>

    <title>Release 1: The First Fixes</title>
    <link href="http://ademagic.com/posts/release-1-the-first-fixes/"/>
    <updated>2020-04-01T11:00:00+11:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>That's what I get for not testing my website more thoroughly. But, like I said, MVP. Heck, this isn't even the design I wanted to release with, so that should tell you something.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to make an effort to document all the changes I make to my website as I go. I think I'd find it interesting to go back over these in some distant future, maybe you'll enjoy it too. Of course, I'm going to be continuously deploying changes as I see fit – I'll still try to document these in release posts. You can find them tagged as <a href="/tags/release">release</a>.</p>
<h3>Blue Favicon</h3>
I changed the favicon to blue after seeing it on a non-dark-mode tab... It reminded me of an <a href="https://www.logolynx.com/topic/nestle+purina+petcare" target="_blank">aussie pet food brand</a>'s logo.
<h3>New body typeface</h3>
I previously used Playfair Display, but given that they're intended for large stylistic headings, I shouldn't have. Lots of hairlines on Chrome for Windows were disappearing. For now, I've changed to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Frank+Ruhl+Libre">Frank Ruhl Libre</a> Regular.
<h3>New background colour</h3>
I changed the body background from `#f4fdfc` to `#fafffe`. I intentionally wanted a white in a blue shade, but this was uncomfortably blue on non-mac screens. I also swapped around the body and footer background colours on dark mode.
<h3>Header and Footer refresh</h3>
I didn't like how my header looked on mobile, so I moved the theme toggle to the footer and redid the footer a little. I also added my logo to my header. I redid the theme toggle as well – I thought the emojis were cute but seeing the non-apple ones in the button made me change my mind. I reverted the design to something like what it was originally in Hylia, though I plan to revisit the theming completely.
<h3>Next</h3>
The next few deployments should actually contain new features this time. I tried to be cute with keeping the old splash page of my site when moving to this new one, but that one took me all of two hours and now looks messy and doesn't fit the rest of the design. I'll be spending most of my time on updating this, and may do it in a few iterations. Other than that I have a few components I want to create for the blog pages, and will redesign my about page as well.
<p>If you've got any suggestions for me, or see any issues, feel free to comment here or drop me a line on any of my socials.</p>

    <title>Hello, World! Again!</title>
    <link href="http://ademagic.com/posts/welcome/"/>
    <updated>2020-03-30T11:00:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://ademagic.com/posts/welcome/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>Very original, I know. Especially because this isn't the first iteration of my website and I bet I've probably used this same line before, even in iterations that never saw the light of the internet. If anything, I'm consistent.</p>
<p>I've had another go at getting a site live, and I'll be trying to blog my way through it as I go. While this site was born in the time of COVID-19, I've been at it for a few months longer. Not working on it constantly, though – There's been a break as I was going through some personal challenges, and obviously the odd redesign. As &quot;perfect is the enemy of done&quot;, recently I've decided to really double down on an &quot;MVP&quot;. This is all content for future blogposts though. And so, here we are.</p>
<p>Every time I've done this, the industry has been different and as a result, so's the tech my site's built in. This time 'round, I've decided to go easy and build with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#heading-eleventy">Eleventy</a> as a static site generator</li>
<li><a href="#heading-hylia">Hylia</a> as a starter template for Eleventy</li>
<li><a href="#heading-github-pages">GitHub Pages</a> for hosting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Eleventy</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">Eleventy</a> is a simple static site generator. This is definitely the best value prop I've seen and is the only intro text on their site before getting straight into how to use it. It's really that simple, <em>but</em> has so much capability as well. I've always been very pro static sites, especially in the ever-complexifying world of web apps and javascript libraries. Maybe coz I'm slightly bitter, but definitely because I'm a fan of simplicity and keeping things lean for the user.</p>
<p>For what I wanted from my site, I also didn't believe I needed the functionality of a complex CMS or backend. This blogpost is written completely in markdown, and it uses <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html" target="_blank">Nunjucks</a> for templating, with front matter for page settings. I have to redeploy the entire site every time I create a new blogpost (well, technically I don't if I'd used Netlify – more on that later). That's ok for me though.</p>
<p>I started out with Eleventy, and getting up and running was simple. It became obvious pretty quickly that there was a lot that I could do with Eleventy that I hadn't even considered, or would take me a while to learn or implement. Eleventy recognises that, too – which is why step 3 of their awesome <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> documentation is <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/" target="_blank">Starter Projects</a>. Enter Hylia.</p>
<h2>Hylia</h2>
<p><a href="https://hylia.website/" target="_blank">Hylia</a> is a starter project for Eleventy, with Netlify CMS preconfigured. If you've already clicked through to the Starter Projects page, you'll see there's no shortage. My research through them was brief – I didn't look much further than <a href="https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw" target="_blank">Andy Bell</a>'s face, and quickly decided on Hylia. This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I follow him on twitter, and know that he puts a focus on semantics, accessibility, and systematic design – so we share a lot of the same values as developers/technologists.</li>
<li>The example site was nice and simple.</li>
<li>I love <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Hylia" target="_blank">Zelda</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After forking the repo I was quickly impressed. The site is generated using <a href="https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group" target="_blank">Design Tokens</a>, meaning the core aspects of the design like colours, sizes/spacing, and fonts could be configured at a very elementary level. I was able to start redesigning the blog in minutes.</p>
<p>It also generates a <code>/styleguide/</code> page from your tokens, which lets you get a quick overview of the changes you make – though the <a href="https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia/tree/master/src/posts" target="_blank">example posts</a> are also helpful while redesigning. Find out more in the <a href="https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia#design-tokens-and-styleguide" target="_blank">README</a>.</p>
<p>It's also got Netlify's CMS preconfigured, which seems to be a strong sell but I didn't consider it. I may well use it eventually, but since I was already working with GitHub Pages, I decided to make things difficult for myself.</p>
<h2>GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>I really like that <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub pages</a> is a thing. Automatically deploying and hosting your github repo's root index file is simple and clever. I've been hosting my site in this way for a few years, mainly because I haven't needed the complexity of my own custom hosting setup and so I also haven't been considering other methods. Now that I've built my site with Eleventy, I'm weighing up my options again.</p>
<p>So, there it is. You've made it this far. Hopefully you found this intro blog useful, and hopefully you'll come back for more later. I've got all sorts of stuff planned – new animations, a nicer About page, heaps of blogposts and projects, probably changing my typography 5 or 6 times... If you've got any feedback for me I'd love some – drop a comment here or <a href="https://twitter.com/miko_a" target="_blank">@ me on twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Stay safe. ✌️</p>
